KAAMELOT DISCORD BOT
===

What is it
---
My friends and I are huge fans of the french TV Series [**Kaamelott**](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaamelott) and we can't stop ourselves to quote infamous inside joke about/from the show.
So when I stumbled upon [a repository](https://github.com/2ec0b4/kaamelott-soundboard) listing a bunch of quotes in small audio format I couldn't resist the urge to use it.

**KaamelottBot** is a silly bot who plays quotes in your current Discord audio-channel when you invoke it in any text-channel with `/kaamelott (+option)`

i.e : 
```
/kaamelott revolte
# Bon ben r√©volte ! TUUUUUUUUT !!
```

Installing the Bot on your Discord channel
---
Open https://discord.com on your browser and login to your account.

Browse https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=610852695128932362&scope=bot&permissions=2150713344 and grant the permission.
(Replace the `client_id` with yours if you run your own server)

Type `/kaamelott poulette` in any channel



How does it work
---
When triggered with `/kaamelott` the bot will use the following words to search for an audio file who's name contains it.

The files comes from [kaamelott-soundboard GitHub](https://github.com/2ec0b4/kaamelott-soundboard/tree/master/sounds) (a copy exists on [pumbaa.ch](http://pumbaa.ch/public/kaamelott/))

The file names and the full quotes are listed in [a JSON file](https://github.com/2ec0b4/kaamelott-soundboard/blob/master/sounds/sounds.json) (again, copy on [pumbaa.ch](http://pumbaa.ch/public/kaamelott/sounds.json))

It take a random quote from the result, download the audio locally, add 3 seconds of blank sound at the end (for some reason the Discord API disconnect too soon and truncate the end of the audio), save all these files in a cache folder and play the sound in the Discord audio-channel you're connected too.

The cached files are stored under [KaamelottBot]\sounds\cache

You need write privileges on this folder (at least `755`) `chmod -R 755 KaamelottBot`.
