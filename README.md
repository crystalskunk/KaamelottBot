KAAMELOT DISCORD BOT
===

What is it
---
My friends and I are huge fans of the french TV Series [**Kaamelott**](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaamelott) and we can't stop ourselves to quote infamous inside joke about/from the show.
So when I stumbled upon [a repository](https://github.com/2ec0b4/kaamelott-soundboard) listing a bunch of quotes in small audio format I couldn't resist the urge to use it.

**KaamelottBot** is a silly bot who plays quotes in your current Discord audio-channel when you invoke it in any text-channel with `!k KEY-WORD`
i.e : 
```
!k revolte
# Bon ben r√©volte !
```

How does it work
---
When triggered with `!k` the bot will use the following words to search for an audio file who's name contains it.
The files comes from http://pumbaa.ch/public/kaamelott/ (TODO use https://github.com/2ec0b4/kaamelott-soundboard/tree/master/sounds ?)
The file names and the full quotes are listed in https://github.com/2ec0b4/kaamelott-soundboard/blob/master/sounds/sounds.json
It take a random quote from the result, download the audio locally, add 3 seconds of blank sound at the end (for some reason the Discord API disconnect too soon and truncate the end of the audio), save all these files in a cache folder and play the sound in the Discord audio-channel you're connected too.
